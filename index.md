Hi, I’m Sumit Tyagi, an experienced ML engineer constantly expanding my knowledge in the AI domain. I started this blog series to share my learnings along the way. I believe that you don’t have to be an expert to share knowledge—what matters is having valuable experiences that others can learn from.

## What's currently on the plate?
